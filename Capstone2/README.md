## Capstone Project 2

## Problem: Quora Insincere Questions Classification
An existential problem for any major website today is how to handle toxic and divisive content.

## Potential Clients:
Quora is a platform that empowers people to learn from each other. On Quora, people can ask questions and connect with others who contribute unique insights and quality answers. By using sentiment analysis, platforms like Quora, they can develop more scalable methods to detect toxic and misleading content to improve online conversations.

## Data
The training set readily available on kaggle. In this project, we will be predicting whether a question asked on Quora is sincere or not. An insincere question is defined as a question intended to make a statement rather than look for helpful answers.

## Data Wrangling

Datas don't have NaN values and '', datas don't need to be cleaned.

## Initial Findings

During exploratory data analysis, we ask the following questions to understand more about our data:
1. How to handle unequal portiation of sincere and insincere questions?
2. How to drop the number of text from 1,306,122 to 1,000?
3. Word frequency?
4. Usually how many tokens are there in a question?
and ask follow-up questions if needed.
